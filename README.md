# ðŸ“¢ Important Announcement
Hello everyone in Atlas Uprising,

For many years, Atlas has been a home and platform for countless people and itâ€™s been an incredible journey. Iâ€™m truly grateful for every moment, every connection, and every memory weâ€™ve built together.

To keep it as straightforward as possible: Atlas Uprising will be shutting down all services after May 20th, 2025.
Tuesday will be our final day. The Discord server will be closed shortly after that.

## ðŸ§¾ Questions
**Q: Why is Atlas shutting down?**
A: After more than 17,000 hours in Garry's Mod across 9 years, my passion for the game has burned out. Atlas Uprising was a project started by me and Soul in 2020, and while Iâ€™ve thought about handing it off, I believe itâ€™s better to shut it down than let it drift under someone elseâ€™s vision. Iâ€™ve tried to reignite the spark, but itâ€™s just not there anymore and something this important deserves more than half-hearted work.

**Q: What about purchases?**
A: Any purchases made within the past 30 days are being refunded. There is currently a 3 day lead time for refunding so your refund may take some time to fully process. This due to a Tebex cooldown period of funds being deposited to issue refunds.

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s Next?
Before we go, I want to give back to the community one last time:

- A public GitHub repository will be released containing all of our code (excluding anything licensed from other developers).

This repo will include:
 - Our custom code
 - Map download link
 - A full dump of our ban database

**Note**: I will not be offering technical support for this codebase. Some basic documentation will be included in the README.

## ðŸ–¤ Final Thoughts
This was never just a server. It was a community, a passion project, and a space where people grew, learned, and found their people. Iâ€™m proud of what we builtâ€”and even prouder of the people who kept it running.

Thank you for being part of this journey.

@everyone
-Mal, Atlas Uprising Discord, 5/19/25
